                    <p>Founded in 1904, Cornell Chinese Student Association (CSA) is Cornell University's oldest
                        cultural association. We are a student-driven social organization that seeks to give a community
                        to students who share a general interest in Chinese and Chinese American culture, and a safe
                        space for social and cultural interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cornell CSA's executive board opens its arms to all individuals curious about our organization
                        and what we do. Feel free to either email or contact us through any of our social platforms. We
                        really do encourage any questions regarding CSA and hope you will reach out to us! It is our
                        pleasure to play a role in shaping your college experience :)</p>

                            CSA strives to create an environment that is open and accepting to all students no matter
                            their background. We seek to constantly serve as a beacon for the Asian-American community
                            at Cornell. We hope that the actions we take strengthen and diversify both the Asian
                            American community and Cornell students seeking a second home.
