                        <li>Fams are groups created by CSA to give Cornell students a home away from home. Each fam
                            consists
                            of bigs and littles who will be paired together based on both parties’ preferences. Once
                            these
                            fams are paired, these will be the people you hang out the most with in CSA, and also the
                            people
                            who may become some of your best friends at Cornell! Think of it as getting a new friend
                            group
                            without having to do much work! These people can become lifelong friends or mentors :)

                        <li>Littles are CSA members who are in their first year of membership with CSA. Typically, new
                            students at Cornell make up the majority of littles in CSA. Littles will be paired with
                            other
                            littles and two to three bigs in a fam.</li>

                            <li>Bigs are older members of CSA who have already been with the organization for at least a
                            year or
                            an upperclassman at Cornell. Bigs can play a variety of roles, from reliable mentors to
                            dependable friends. But no matter what, a big is there to help littles to acclimate to CSA
                            and
                            the Cornell community while making memories along the way." </li>

                            Social Week typically occurs after ClubFest in the Fall semester, so remember to keep an eye
                            out
                            for the schedule on our socials. Historically, we've found that littles who attend more
                            Social
                            Week events and really get to know the bigs will join fams that they truly connect with!

                            the newsletter, on Instagram, or in our Links section of this website! Typically, a group of
                            2-3
                            bigs will get together to make a fam and each will fill out the form to submit before Social
                            Week. <b>You do not need to be a previous member to become a big!!</b> All you need to do is

                            membership fee and sign up to be a member! Bigs will also need to attend a certain number of
                            events during Social Week so that they are able to get to know the littles!

                            mingle, connect, and find their new fam for the year. At the end of this week, bigs and
                            littles
                            will finally get paired with their fams at our Fam Reveal! Check our Instagram and Facebook

                            than
                            only having a few events each year, CSA strives to be a constant presence during your time
                            at
                            Cornell. The point system rewards CSA fams who send pictures of their hangouts together,
                            either
                            at CSA events or on your own time. For example, if your fam celebrates a birthday together,
                            you
                            can send in a picture or tag us on social media to get featured and receive points. Fams
                            that
                            reach certain milestones will receive rewards depending on the number of points. The fam
                            with
                            the most points at the end of the year will also get a special prize! <a
