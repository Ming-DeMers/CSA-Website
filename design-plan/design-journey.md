# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client the Chinese Student Associate (CSA). Specifically, we'll be working with Arthur and Tiffany, members of the e-board. Our client is a student organization requiring a static website redesign.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

 CSA is a student-run social and cultural organization that seeks to provide a community to students interested in Chinese and Chinese American culture. They have a social week where interested students can meet current members and join their fam (family), and they also host multiple cultural and social events throughout the year (Mid autumn festival, Midnight Dimsum, etc)

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

The organization is unique because they offer a community to anyone who is interested in both Chinese and Chinese American culture, and the club isn’t limited to just Chinese members. They are also the organization that hosts the largest annual Mid-autumn festival event at Cornell on Ho Plaza, and their events like Midnight Dim Sum are also unique.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

 The website could look a bit more visually pleasing.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

They want people who are interested in the club and its events to check out the website. This year, they've decided to put important links to the club’s events (sign ups, etc) on their website, so intended audience is members but also anyone else interested in CSA events or joining CSA.

1. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

 Visitors typically visit the website to join the newsletter or find links to important sign-up forms and other resources (E-board applications, etc). They also want visitors to check out the gallery so they can see what events are like

2. What are your goals for this site?

For visitors to learn more about CSA as an organization and want to join the club

4. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

Would like to stick with a red theme (not bright red, the current red is fine). Faving faces on the website is important as well.



3. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

Don't have any favorites, but can check out usc’s casa website and Harvard’s c


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

Time: ~10 minutes
Notes: CSA is a widely known cultural organization on Cornell's campus (and other schools). The org is not limited to just Chinese students; anyone can join as long as they are able to meet the social week requirements and fill out the form. The client currently wants to make the website more visually appealing while keeping the current color theme and hopes to allow the audience who visit their site (students interested in joining the club and current students already in the club) to help them find information regarding club events and how to sign up. In addition, the website provides the link to the newsletter along with sign-ups for the events; this is important information that the audience typically looks for. The client is looking to revamp their website to udpate its aesthetics while keeping the content that already exists on the site.


### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

TODO: tell us about the website you intend to design and build


### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- TODO: Goal 1
- TODO: Goal 2
- TODO: Goal 3
- ...


### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

We intend to build a redesign of the current CSA website. Each member will be responsible for creating one page, as well as an extra duty that spans the entire website, such as format consistency. We hope this a is a manageable workload for all members that will result in a quality website.


## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

Next up, we plan to find members of CSA and non-members to interview for user interviews. By the weekend, we hope to have interviews written so we may know whom to aim for. Those who are not involved with the interviewing will begin site construction: filling out content and creating an initial theme with little styling.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** "Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am designing the website for (TODO: client's name). I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10 minutes. You are free to quit at any time."

### Interview Notes (Milestone 2)
> Interview at least 1 person for every member of your team from your audience.
> Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.
> **Copy the interview questions above into each interviewee section below.**

**Interviewee 1: Keri Yamaguchi**

1. Please tell me a bit about yourself. You may omit any personal or private information.

Keri Y. is a Japanese-Chinese American and she has lived in Upstate NY her whole life. She went to a predominately white school district and she was exposed to very little diversity during this time.

2. What cultural clubs have you heard about on campus at Cornell? How did you hear about these clubs?

"Csa, JUSA, kasa, ksa. I hear them from social media platforms, specifically Instagram. Also, a lot of times it spreads by word of mouth as my friens also talked about them near the beginning of the school year."

3. When you're looking for information about these clubs where would you look?

"I would also go on Instagram for information regarding these organizations because I assume that these orgs have an Instagram page that stays up to date either with their LinkTree or posts regarding information and upcoming events."

4. What kind of information regarding the club would you be interested in finding?

"Information such as general meetings and events. "

5. What haven't I asked you today that you think would be valuable for me to know?
