# Group Project: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Client (Milestone 1)

### Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client the Chinese Student Associate (CSA). Specifically, we'll be working with Arthur and Tiffany, members of the e-board. Our client is a student organization requiring a static website redesign.

### Client Questionnaire (Milestone 1)
> Develop a client questionnaire to learn more about your client and their goals.
> You may use the questionnaire below, you may modify the questionnaire below, or you may create your own.

1. Describe your organization and its purpose.

 CSA is a student-run social and cultural organization that seeks to provide a community to students interested in Chinese and Chinese American culture. They have a social week where interested students can meet current members and join their fam (family), and they also host multiple cultural and social events throughout the year (Mid autumn festival, Midnight Dimsum, etc)

2. What makes your organization and its services special or unique?

The organization is unique because they offer a community to anyone who is interested in both Chinese and Chinese American culture, and the club isn’t limited to just Chinese members. They are also the organization that hosts the largest annual Mid-autumn festival event at Cornell on Ho Plaza, and their events like Midnight Dim Sum are also unique.

3. Why are you looking for a new website or updating your existing site?

 The website could look a bit more visually pleasing.

4. Who do you want to visit your site? Who do you believe is your website's intended audience?

They want people who are interested in the club and its events to check out the website. This year, they've decided to put important links to the club’s events (sign ups, etc) on their website, so intended audience is members but also anyone else interested in CSA events or joining CSA.

1. When visiting your site, what actions do you want your visitors to take?

 Visitors typically visit the website to join the newsletter or find links to important sign-up forms and other resources (E-board applications, etc). They also want visitors to check out the gallery so they can see what events are like

2. What are your goals for this site?

For visitors to learn more about CSA as an organization and want to join the club

4. Is there a "feel" that you want for your site? Are there colors or imagery that you have in mind?

Would like to stick with a red theme (not bright red, the current red is fine). Faving faces on the website is important as well.

3. What are your three favorite competitors or similar organizations' websites? Why?

Don't have any favorites, but can check out usc’s casa website and Harvard’s c


### First Client Meeting Minutes/Notes (Milestone 1)
> Include your notes/minutes from your first meeting with your client.

Time: ~10 minutes
Notes: CSA is a widely known cultural organization on Cornell's campus (and other schools). The org is not limited to just Chinese students; anyone can join as long as they are able to meet the social week requirements and fill out the form. The client currently wants to make the website more visually appealing while keeping the current color theme and hopes to allow the audience who visit their site (students interested in joining the club and current students already in the club) to help them find information regarding club events and how to sign up. In addition, the website provides the link to the newsletter along with sign-ups for the events; this is important information that the audience typically looks for. The client is looking to revamp their website to udpate its aesthetics while keeping the content that already exists on the site.


### Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants.
> Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> Note: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page from the context menu (right click).)
> If you are redesigning an existing site, tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

Current CSA Website and Screenshots:
<https://www.csacornell.org/>
![Welcome screenshot](./welcome.png)
![Eboard screenshot](./eboard.png)
![Gallery screenshot info](./gallery.png)
![Links screenshot](./links.png)
![Membership info screenshot](./membership.png)
![About screenshot](./about.png)
![Navigation screenshot](./nav.png)

The website we intend to build will keep the current color theme but will include more interactivity. We will also make the layout consistent for all the pages. For example, the membership page has a side menu bar while the other pages do not. One of the main goals of the users who visit this website is to learn about the events that CSA hosts. We will create an "Events" page that includes photos and information about the events so that is easier for the users to find this information. The client wanted a more aesthetically pleasing website and highlighted the importance of photos so we will disperse photos throughout the website more than there currently are.


### Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> Identify your client's goals for the website.
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- A more visually appealing website ( pictures of members throughout)
- Information about the organization should be easily accessible for users
- Convey a fun communal image of the organization which encourages users to join
- Colors scheme should be consistent with the idea of China (red)
- Highlight the communal aspect which is central to the organization


### Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> We want your project to be successful! It needs to be ambitious, but not too large.
> A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big.
> Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

We intend to build a redesign of the current CSA website. Each member will be responsible for creating one page, as well as an extra duty that spans the entire website, such as format consistency. We hope this a is a manageable workload for all members that will result in a quality website.


## Plan/Schedule (Milestone 1)
> Make a plan of when you will complete all parts of this assignment.
> This plan is for your team. There is no required format. Format it so that it works for you!
> Your plan should include when you will interview users and analyze their goals.
> Your plan should also include how and when you will assemble/create the sit's content.
> **Tip:** Your team should plan to work ahead. This project really isn't feasible to complete the night before a deadline.

Next up, we plan to find members of CSA and non-members to interview for user interviews. By the weekend, we hope to have interviews written so we may know whom to aim for. Those who are not involved with the interviewing will begin site construction: filling out content and creating an initial theme with little styling.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality, but it doesn't have to be fancy.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.
> You may use the interview template below and revise it as much as you desire.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** "Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project, I am designing the website for Cornell's Chinese Student Association. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site.

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Learn what CSA is about, what they do?

- **Design Ideas and Choices** To emphasize/make it clear for the user what CSA stands for as a club, we will place this information in an easily accessible location for the user.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Giving the about information it's own page ensures the user will be able to easily find the information since it will be clearly listed in the navigation bar. Being on it's individual page will prevent the user from having to dig through pages to find the about information since it will have its own designated location.

Goal 2: Find out what events CSA is organizing/has organized in the past

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Similar to the design for the home page to the apple-fest project 2. Upcoming events will be explicitly displayed on the home landing page so it is the first thing visitors to the website see.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By displaying the upcoming event as the first thing visitors see it will serve as an invite for users to come to the event and experience what CSA is about first hand. Since CSA is a cultural/social club events are very important in connecting members together.

Goal 3: See current members of CSA to see if any mutuals are a part of the club

**Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - Have a gallery of member pictures for eboard and photos of people who attended CSA events and photos of fams within CSA.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - By having a gallery of images visitors to the website can see snippets of CSA members, not only will the gallery show users the fun atmosphere of events but they may also see a mutual friend in the club and this will encourage them to be more likely to join CSA.


### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience.
> Be specific and justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group with regard to your website.

TODO: site's _cohesive_ audience


## Website Design Exploration (Milestone 2)

Identify three websites (preferably static websites) that exist today on the web to draw inspiration from. Please select websites that are similar to the website you wish to create.

Include two screenshots of the home page for each site: narrow and wide.

**We'll refer to these are your "example websites."**

### Example Website 1 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

TODO: website reflection/critique


### Example Website 2 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

TODO: website reflection/critique


### Example Website 3 Review (Milestone 2)
> Review the website you identified above. (1 paragraph)
> In your review, include a discussion common design patterns and interactivity in the site.

Upenn's CSA website has three pages: "home," "events," "big little," and "board." The pages are linked at the top right corner and do not link to external pages, but rather they rubber band down to the section on the main page that discusses the section. The interactivity elements utilized are automatic scrolling gallery, carousel gallery, opening to external links, horizontal scrolling to access "events" (both upcoming and past).


## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

Plan your site's content.

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List **all** the content you plan to include your website.

- About information text
- Event information text
- Photos of Eboard
- Photos of events/people at events
- Images of CSA logoo
- FAQ test
- Membership information text


### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how the content addresses their goals.

This content is the right content for the site's audience because the text will relay information that they need (that was found through conducting user interviews) such as what the club is about, how to be a member, what events are hosted, and an FAQ section will be included to answer any general questions that come up from people. Then, the images and pictures will provide the visual aspects to give students an idea on what the events look like. In doing this, viewers can have an idea of what the mood and structure of CSA is like. Also, there will be a section to display e-board members, which gives a face to the organization for the people viewing the website.

- TODO: interactivity idea 1
- TODO: interactivity idea 2
- TODO: ...


### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
> Iterate on your site's design through sketching.
