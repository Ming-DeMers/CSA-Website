# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This contract is a _living_ document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Contract

Your team contract should probably include these elements. Feel free to remove or add other terms, too.

1. To what goals do we all commit?

    - Produce a website that meets the requirements and best represents our skills and  effort
    - Create a website that fulfills the clients specific needs satisfactorily
    - Create a website that completes the users needs and requirements
    - Create a website that is visually pleasing, appropriately accessible, and reactive to users needs

2. What are our "ground rules"? (Don't make an exhaustive listâ€”stick with just a few.)

    **Tip:** Interrupting another person can make them feel like their option isn't valued. Consider a rule about interrupting.
    - Respect each other's time and ideas. Avoid interrupting, desconstructive communication, and untimely work.
    - Produce work that is on time and functional
    - Members put in equal effort and similarly-sized content. 
  
3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

    TODO: discuss and document here

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for. (**No "coder" or "designer" roles are permitted;** everyone must design and code.)

    **Tip:** It's often helpful to think of **responsibilities** rather than roles here.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

    TODO: discuss and document here

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

    TODO: discuss and document here

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

    TODO: discuss and document here

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? Maybe you team needs a _fun_ clause...

    **Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

TODO: what else belongs in your team's contract?

## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract.** If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the contract, please email the instructors at <info1300-prof@cornell.edu>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?" You must attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
